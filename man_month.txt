I just started reading the Mythical Man Month. A collection of essays on software engineering by Fredrick Brooks.
I finished the first two essays.. the tar pit and the mythical man month. There are several good take aways.
The main one is that the more people you put on a programming job will not always make things get done faster.
Often it is the opposite. Similar to a tar pit, the more limbs are lashing out, the more stuck in the quagmire you become. 
Another take away is actually credited to Dorothy Sayers in "the Mind of the Maker", but I credit my art 3 teachers.
The point is that there are three stages to any creative activity. The conception, the execution, and the interaction. 
In my art class, it was about "what is art?". If you paint a beautiful painting and it gets buried in the ground and no one ever sees it..
is it art? He argued no. To complete the cycle of art there must be a beholder.. someone to experience the piece to make it art. 
Focusing on these stages intentionally and seperately greatly increases your chances of success in a completed software project. 

A great quote from the first essay is
"The real tiger is never a match for the paper one, unless actual use is wanted"

He also referrences a rule of thumb for scheduling a software task that has been successful.

1/3 planning
1/6 coding
1/4 component test and early systems test
1/4 system test, all components in hand
